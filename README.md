# fruits-rest-api
A simple serverless REST API built on AWS

This repo was created to prepare for a brown bag session.
It has a few API endpoints handled by AWS lambdas behind AWS API Gateway that writes to and read from AWS DynamoDB.

## Dependencies
It uses [serverless-components](https://github.com/serverless/components) for fast development, which requires NodeJS and [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless).
